"""Runs the dynamic-des simulation that writes all four tables, for the backfill and the daily run.

Each simulated hour publishes that hour's forecasts and reading. When a day ends, it
also publishes that day's daily weather and air quality, computed from the same hourly
rows. dynamic-des's Iceberg writer sends each row to its table: the backfill appends
into new tables, and the daily run upserts on each table's keys, so running a day again
replaces it.
